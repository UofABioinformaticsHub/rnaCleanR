Description: This package aims to quantify and remove putative double strand DNA from a strand-specific RNA sample. There are also options and methods to plot the positive/negative proportions of all sliding windows, which allow users to have an idea of how much the sample was contaminated and the appropriate threshold to be used for filtering.
