Description: This package aims to quantify and remove contaminated double strand DNA from a strand-specific RNA sample. It uses a window sliding across each chromosome, and consider the proportion of positive/negative reads in each window comparing to a given threshold, to decide wheather a window is kept or removed. Then we assigne to each read fragment a probability of being kept based on the proportion of positive/negative of the kept windows that contain the fragment. There are also options and methods to plot the positive/negative proportions of all sliding windows, which allow users to have an idea of how much the sample was contaminated and the appropriate threshold to be used.
