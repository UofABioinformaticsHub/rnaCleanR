#' @title Filter Single End Bam File
#'
#' @description Filter putative double strand DNA from a strand specific RNA-seq using a window sliding across the genome.

#'
#' @param bamfilein the input bam file to be filterd. Your bamfile should be sorted and have an index file located at the same path as well.
#' @param bamfileout the output filtered bam file
#' @param statfile the file to write the summary of the results
#' @param chromosomes the list of chromosomes to be filtered
#' @param yieldSize by default is 1e8, i.e. the bam file is read by block of chromosomes such that the total length of each block is at least 1e8
#' @param mustKeepRanges a GRanges object defines the ranges such that every read maps to those ranges must be always kept regardless the strand proportion of the windows containing them.
#' @param getWin if TRUE, the function will return a data frame containing the information of all windows. It's FALSE by default.
#' @param win the length of the sliding window, 1000 by default.
#' @param step the step length to sliding the window, 100 by default.
#' @param threshold the threshold upper which we keep the reads. 0.7 by default
#' @param pvalueThreshold the threshold for the p-value. 0.05 by default
#' @param min if a window has least than min reads, then it will be rejected regardless the strand proportion. 0 by default
#' @param max if a window has more than max reads, then it will be kept regardless the strand proportion. If 0 then it doesn't have effect on selecting window. 0 by default.
#' @param errorRate the probability that an RNA read takes the false strand. 0.01 by default
#' @param limit a read is considered to be included in a window if and only if at least limit percent of it is in the window. 0.75 by default
#' @param coverage if TRUE, then the strand information in each window corresponds to the sum of coverage coming from positive/negative reads; and not the number of positive/negative reads as default.
#'
#'
#' @details filterDNA reads a bam file containing strand specific RNA reads, and filter putative double strand DNA.
#' Using a window sliding across the genome, we calculate the positive/negative proportion of reads in that window.
#' For each window, we use logistic regression to estimate the proportion of reads in the window derived from
#' stranded RNA (positive or negative).
#'
#' \eqn{\pi}: proportion of reads in the window derived from stranded RNA (positive or negative)
#'
#' Null hypothesis: \eqn{\pi < {\pi}_{0}} where \eqn{{\pi}_{0}} is the given threshold.
#'
#' Only windows with p-value <= 0.05 are kept. Considering a positive window that is kept, let P be its number of positive reads, and let M
#' be its number of negative reads. Since these M negative reads should come from double-strand DNA, then there should be also M postive reads among the
#' P positive reads come from double-strand DNA. In other words, there are only (P-M) positive reads come from RNA. Hence, each positive read in this window is kept
#' with the probability equalling (P-M)/P. Each negative read is kept with the probability equalling the given errorRate which is the rate that
#' an RNA read of your sample has wrong strand.
#'
#' Since each alignment can be belonged to several windows, then the probability of keeping an alignment is the maximum probability defined by
#' all windows that contain it.
