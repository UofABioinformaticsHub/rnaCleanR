#' @title Plot the number of reads vs positive proportion of the input windows.

#' @description Plot the number of reads vs positive proportion, and the groups of the input windows. This method is called by the function getPlot or filterOne.

#' @param windows data frame containing the positive proportion of each window, the sum of reads of the window and the coverage group that it belongs to.
#' Windows are normally calculated in the method getPlot or fitlerOne. These methods groupe windows based on their maximum coverage: by default definition, groups spead from 1 to 8, which correspond to the max coverage respectively in the range "0-10","10-20","20-50","50-100","100-200","200-500","500-1000",">1000"
#' @param winfile the file to write the window plot
#' @param xlim xlim of the window plot
#' 
#' @seealso getPlot, filterOne
