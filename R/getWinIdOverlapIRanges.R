#' @description Get the Ranges of Sliding Windows that overlap an IRanges 
#' object. 
#' 
#' @details
#' This finds the windows that overlap each fragment of a read and returns a 
#' range containing this list of windows for each read fragment.
#' This allows the total number of read fragments within a window to be 
#' calculated simply using \link{coverage}.
#' 
#' @param x an IRanges object containing the start and end position of 
#' each read fragment. 
#' @param winWidth the width of the sliding window, 1000 by default.
#' @param winStep the step length to sliding the window, 100 by default.
#' @param readProp A read is considered to be included in a window if at least 
#' \code{readProp} of it is in the window. Specified as a proportion.
#' @param maxWin The maximum window ID
#' 
#' @export
#' @return An IRanges object containing the index of the windows containing 
#' each read fragment
#' @examples

#' x <- IRanges(start=round(runif(100,1000,10000)),width=100)
