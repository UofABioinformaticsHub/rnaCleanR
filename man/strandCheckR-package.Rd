\title{
  Quantify and Filter putative double strand DNA from strand-specific RNA bam file
}
\description{
  This package aims to quantify and remove putative double strand DNA from a strand-specific RNA sample. There are also options and methods to plot the positive/negative proportions of all sliding windows, which allow users to have an idea of how much the sample was contaminated and the appropriate threshold to be used for filtering.
}

\details{
 The package has some following main functions:
 
 - getWinFromBamFile: calculate positive/negative proprortion and sum of reads over all sliding windows from a single end bam file
 
 - getWinFromPairedBamFile: calculate positive/negative proprortion and sum of reads over all sliding windows from a paried end bam file
 
 - filterDNA: filter a single end bam file
 
 - filterDNAPairs: filter a paired end bam file
}
