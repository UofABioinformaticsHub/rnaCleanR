\arguments{
\item{winPosAlignments}{a list that has a `Coverage` field containing 
coverage coming from positive reads}

coverage coming from negative reads}

\item{winWidth}{the length of the sliding window, 1000 by default.}

\item{winStep}{the step length to sliding the window, 100 by default.}
}
\value{
a list of two vectors, containing a positive/negative coverage of 
the input positive/negative windows
}
\description{
Calculate the coverage coming from '+'/'-' reads 
in all sliding windows
