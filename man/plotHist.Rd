\title{Plot the histogram of positive proportions of the input windows data frame}
\usage{
plotHist(windows, group = c(10, 100, 1000), save = FALSE,
  file = "hist.pdf", facet_wrap_chromosomes = FALSE, useCoverage = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{windows}{data frame containing the number of positive/negative reads for each window
Windows can be get by the function \code{getWinFromBamFile}.}

\item{group}{an integer vector that specifies how you want to partition the windows based on the number of reads. By default \code{group} = c(10,100,1000), which means that your windows will be parition into 4 groups, those have number of reads < 10, from 10 to 100, from 100 to 1000, and > 1000}

\item{save}{if TRUE, then the plot will be save into the file given by \code{file} parameter}

\item{file}{the file name to save to plot}

\item{facet_wrap_chromosomes}{if TRUE, then the plots will be splitted by chromosomes. FALSE by default}

\item{useCoverage}{if TRUE then plot the coverage strand information, otherwise plot the number of reads strand information. FALSE by default}
