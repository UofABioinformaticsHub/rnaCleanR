\usage{
concatenateAlignments(bam, sequenceInfo)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam}{a list returned by \code{scanBam} function, each element 
correspond to a sequence, containing the information of strand, starting 
position, cigar string, and eventually flag, qname}

\item{sequenceInfo}{a data frame that contains some key information of the 
alignments}
}
\value{
the concatenated alignments of the input list
}
