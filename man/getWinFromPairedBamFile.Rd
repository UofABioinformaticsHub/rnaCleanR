\title{get the number of positive/negatives of all windows from a paired end bam file}
\usage{
getWinFromPairedBamFile(bamfilein, mq = 0, chromosomes,
  partitionSize = 1e+08, win = 1000, step = 100, limit = 0.75,
  coverage = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bamfilein}{the input paired-end bam file. Your bamfile should be sorted and have an index file located at the same path as well.}

\item{mq}{every read that has mapping quality below \code{mq} will be removed before any analysis}

\item{chromosomes}{the list of chromosomes to be read}

\item{partitionSize}{by default is 1e8, i.e. the bam file is read by block of chromosomes such that the total length of each block is at least 1e8}

\item{win}{the length of the sliding window, 1000 by default.}

\item{step}{the step length to sliding the window, 100 by default.}

\item{limit}{a read is considered to be included in a window if and only if at least \code{limit} percent of it is in the window. 0.75 by default}

\item{coverage}{if TRUE, then the strand information in each window corresponds to the sum of coverage coming from positive/negative reads; and not the number of positive/negative reads as default.}
