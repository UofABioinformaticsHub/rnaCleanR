\usage{
.getStrandFromReadInfo(readInfo, winWidth = 1000L, winStep = 100L,
  readProp = 0.5, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{readInfo}{a list contains read information returned by 
\code{\link{scanBam}} function when read a bam file}

\item{winWidth}{the width of the sliding window, 1000 by default.}

\item{readProp}{A read is considered to be included in a window if at least
\code{readProp} of it is in the window. Specified as a proportion.
0.5 by default.}

\item{subset}{an integer vector specifying the subset of reads to consider}
}
\value{
a DataFrame object containing the number of positive/negative reads 
and coverage of each window sliding
}
