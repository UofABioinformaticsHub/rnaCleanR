\title{Plot the number of reads vs positive proportion of the input windows data frame.}
\usage{
plotWin(windows, threshold = c(0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), pvalue = 0.05,
  save = FALSE, file = "win.pdf", facet_wrap_chromosomes = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{windows}{data frame containing the number of positive/negative reads for each window
Windows can be get by calling the function \code{getWin} (for single end bam file) or \code{getWinPairs} (for paired end bam file).}

\item{threshold}{a real vector that specifies which threshold lines you want to draw on the plot. The positive window above the threshold line (or negative window below the threshold line) will be kept if we use that threshold to filter the data. By default, the thresholds 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 will be plotted.}

\item{pvalue}{0.05 by default, any window has pvalue below it in the test comparing with a threshold will be kept.}

\item{save}{if TRUE, then the plot will be save into the file given by \code{file} parameter}

\item{file}{the file name to save to plot}

\item{facet_wrap_chromosomes}{if TRUE, then the plots will be splitted by chromosomes. FALSE by default}

\item{group}{an integer vector that specifies how you want to partition the windows based on the number of reads. By default group = c(10,100,1000), which means that your windows will be parition into 4 groups, those have number of reads < 10, from 10 to 100, from 100 to 1000, and > 1000}
