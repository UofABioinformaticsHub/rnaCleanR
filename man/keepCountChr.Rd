\title{Calculate the Reads to be Kept for one Chromosome}
\usage{
keepCountChr(nbSample, alignmentChr, len, win, step, pvalueThreshold, minCov,
  maxCov, limit, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{nbSample}{number of samples in consideration}

\item{alignmentChr}{the alignments of the considerint chromosome for all samples}

\item{len}{the length of the considering chromosome}

\item{win}{the length of the sliding window}

\item{step}{the step length to slide the window}

\item{pvalueThreshold}{the threshold for the p-value}

\item{minCov}{if a window has the max coverage least than minCov, then it will be rejected}

\item{maxCov}{if a window has the max coverage greater than maxCov, then it will be kept}

\item{limit}{the proportion that a read must be inside a window in order to be counted}

\item{threshold}{the threshold upper which we keep the reads}
