\title{filter one bamfile based on the strand specifict of itself. Strand of sliding windows are caculated based on read counts.}
\usage{
filterOneCount(bamfilein, bamfileout, chromosomes = NULL, win = 1000,
  step = 100, threshold, pvalueThreshold = 0.05, minR = 0, maxR = 0,
  limit = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{bamfilein}{the input bam file to be filterd}

\item{bamfileout}{the output bam file}

\item{chromosomes}{the list of chromosomes to be filtered}

\item{win}{the length of the sliding window}

\item{step}{the step length to slide the window}

\item{threshold}{the threshold upper which we keep the reads}

\item{pvalueThreshold}{the threshold for the p-value}

\item{minR}{if a window has least than minR reads then it will be all cleaned}

\item{limit}{the proportion of a read that it should not exceed to be considered to be in a window}
