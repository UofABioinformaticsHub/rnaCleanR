\usage{
getWinFromIRanges(x, winWidth = 1000L, winStep = 100L, readProp = 0,
  maxWin = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an IRanges object containing the start and end position of 
each read fragment}

\item{winWidth}{The width of each window}

\item{winStep}{The step size for sliding the window}

\item{readProp}{A read is considered to be included in a window if more than 
\code{readProp} of it is in the window. Specified as a proportion.}

\item{maxWin}{The maximum window ID}
}
\value{
An IRanges object containing the index of the windows containing 
each read fragment
}
\description{
Get the Ranges of Sliding Windows from an IRanges object
}
\details{
This finds the windows that overlap each fragment of a read and returns a 
range containing
this list of windows for each read fragment.
This allows the total number of read fragments within a window to be 
calculated simply using \link{coverage}.
