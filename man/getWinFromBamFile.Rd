\usage{
getWinFromBamFile(files, sequences, mapqFilter = 0, yieldSize = 1e+06,
  winWidth = 1000L, winStep = 100L, readProp = 0.5, paired)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{the input bam files. Your bamfiles should be sorted and have 
their index files located at the same path.}

\item{sequences}{character vector used to restrict analysed alignments to a 
subset of chromosomes (i.e. sequences) within the provided bam file. 
These correspond to chromosomes/scaffolds of the reference genome to which 
the reads were mapped. If absent, the whole bam file will be read.
NB: This must match the chromosomes as defined in your reference genome.
If the reference chromosomes were specified using the 'chr' prefix, ensure 
the supplied vector matches this specification.}

\item{mapqFilter}{every read that has mapping quality below 
\code{mapqFilter} will be removed before any analysis.}

\item{yieldSize}{by default is 1e6, i.e. the bam file is read by block of
records whose size is defined by this parameter. It is used to pass to same
parameter of the scanBam function.}

\item{winWidth}{the width of the sliding window, 1000 by default.}

\item{winStep}{the step length to sliding the window, 100 by default.}

\item{readProp}{A read is considered to be included in a window if at least
\code{readProp} of it is in the window. Specified as a proportion.
0.5 by default.}

\item{paired}{if TRUE then the input bamfile will be considered as paired 
end reads. If missing, 100 thousands first reads will be inspected to test 
if the input bam file in paired end or single end.}
}
\value{
a DataFrame object containing the number of positive/negative reads 
and coverage of each window sliding across the bam file.
The returned DataFrame has 10 columns:

Type: can be either SE if the input file contains single-end reads,
or R1/R2 if the input file contains paired-end reads.

Seq: the reference sequence (chromosome/scaffold) that the reads were mapped
to.

Start: the start position of the sliding window.

End: the end position of the sliding window.

NbPos/NbNeg: number of positive/negative reads that overlap the sliding 
window.

CovPos/CovNeg: number of bases coming from positive/negative reads that were 
mapped in the sliding window.

MaxCoverage: the maximum coverage within the sliding window.

File: the name of the input file.
}
\description{
Get the number of positive/negative reads of all windows from 
bam files
}
\details{
This function moves along the specified chromosomes (i.e. sequences) using a
sliding window approach, and counts the number of reads in each window which 
align to the +/- strands of the reference genome.
As well as the number of reads, the total coverage for each strand is also 
returned for each window, representing the total number of bases covered.

Average coverage for the entire window can be simply calculated by dividing 
the total coverage by the window size.
