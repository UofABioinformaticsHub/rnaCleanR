\title{get the number of positive/negative reads of all windows from a single end bam file}
\usage{
getWinFromBamFile(file, chromosomes, mapq = 0, partitionSize = 1e+08,
  winWidth = 1000, step = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{the input single-end bam file. Your bamfile should be sorted and have an index file located at the same path as well.}

\item{chromosomes}{the list of chromosomes to be read}

\item{mapq}{very read that has mapping quality below \code{mapq} will be removed before any analysis}

\item{partitionSize}{by default is 1e8, i.e. the bam file is read by blocks of chromosomes 
such that the total length of each block is at least 1e8}

\item{winWidth}{the width of the sliding window, 1000 by default.}

\item{step}{the step length to sliding the window, 100 by default.}
}

file <- system.file("data","s1.chr1.bam",package = "strandCheckR")
